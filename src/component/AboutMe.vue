        <p class="text-bold text-xs font-medium mt-2">WHERE I'M FROM</p>
        <p class="mb-5 text-xl">I’m from Hanoi, Vietnam — born and raised. My dad’s a farmer, my mom’s a full-time home CEO (aka housewife). Growing up, I was told to study hard, eat more, and not break the fan (classic Vietnamese parenting). Life was simple, loud, and full of food.</p>
        <p class="text-bold text-xs font-medium mt-2">WHAT I USED TO DO</p>
        <p class="mb-5 text-xl">I started working when I was a teenager — from serving coffee at a local café, selling clothes in the <em>Old Quarter</em>, to delivering packages across the city on my trusty motorbike. Not glamorous, but I learned how to talk to people and how not to spill a full tray of iced coffee on someone's laptop <strong class="text-gray-400">(happened once, never again).</strong></p>
        <p class="text-bold text-xs font-medium mt-2">WHAT I DO NOW</p>
        <p class="mb-5 text-xl">Today, my major is a Software Developer at <a href="https://www.fpt.edu.vn/" class="underline"><span class="text-gray-900">FPT University</span></a>, building things that (hopefully) don’t <del>crash</del>. I write code, break it, fix it, and repeat. Some days it feels like magic. Other days… well, there’s <strong class="text-gray-600">"Stack Overflow".</strong></p>
        <p class="text-bold text-xs font-medium mt-2">WHERE I'M AT NOW</p>
        <p class="mb-5 text-xl">Still in Hanoi — a city that never stops honking. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me eating street food, playing games, or hanging out somewhere quiet to balance out the noise..</p>
        <p class="text-bold text-xs font-medium mt-2">WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR</p>
        <p class="mb-5 text-xl">I’m looking for exciting work — the kind that challenges me, teaches me, and lets me build something real with cool people. I believe great software starts with great teams. Also, I low-key think the keyboard deserves its iPhone moment too.</p>
